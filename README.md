# Awesome Python Codemods [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This is mainly a self reference, but feel free to use it as well! ðŸ¤—

Honestly, I don't think the Python ecosystem has a lot of codemods, or references to work with them.
So, I decided to create this repository to keep track of the ones I find. ðŸ˜„

## Codemods

- [Bump TestClient]: Replace Starlette's TestClient from `requests` to `httpx`! ðŸŽ‰
- [No Optional]: Replace `Optional[T]` by `Union[T, None]` ðŸ‘€
- [Only Relative Import]: Only allow relative imports! ðŸ˜…

## Packages

- [LibCST-Mypy]: Type inference provider using mypy for LibCST! âœ¨
- [Metaproj]: I don't know how to describe, but has some cool ideas.
